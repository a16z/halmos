Halmos is a _symbolic testing_ tool for EVM smart contracts. A Solidity/Foundry frontend is currently offered by default, with plans to provide support for other languages, such as Vyper and Huff, in the future.

## Installation

### ‚≠ê Using `uv` (recommended for most users)

```sh
# install uv if you don't have it already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# install the latest version of halmos for the current user and add it to PATH
uv tool install halmos

# or, install the development version from the repository
# uv tool install git+https://github.com/a16z/halmos

# after installing, you can update halmos to the latest version with:
uv tool upgrade halmos
```

### Using `docker`

You can download a pre-built Docker image that contains python, halmos, its dependencies, foundry, solvers, etc.:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/a16z/halmos:latest
```

### Using `pip` (for advanced users)

Note: this is not recommended because of the extra work required to manage the python version and the virtual environment. But if you know what you are doing, and need the extra control, you can do it like this:

```sh
# make sure you have a suitable python version installed, e.g.:
python3.12 --version

# create and activate a virtual environment with an explicit python version
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# install the latest version of halmos
pip install halmos

# or, install the development version from the repository
pip install git+https://github.com/a16z/halmos
```

## Usage

```sh
cd /path/to/src
halmos
```

For more details:

```sh
halmos --help
```

Alternatively, you can run the latest halmos Docker image available at [ghcr.io/a16z/halmos](ghcr.io/a16z/halmos):

```sh
cd /path/to/src

# mount '.' under /workspace in the container
docker run -v .:/workspace ghcr.io/a16z/halmos:latest
```
