# Halmos

_Symbolic Bounded Model Checker for Ethereum Smart Contracts Bytecode_

**_Symbolic_:** Halmos executes the given contract bytecode against symbolic function arguments and symbolic storage states. This makes Halmos to systematically explore all possible behaviors of the contract.

**_Bounded_:** Halmos unrolls unbounded loops up to a specific bound, and set variable-length arrays to be of a specific size. This allows Halmos to run automatically without requiring additional user annotations.

**_Model Checking_:** Halmos proves that assertions are never violated by any inputs; otherwise, it provides a counter-example. This means that Halmos can be used for finding bugs as well as formal verification of the given contract.

## Installation

```
$ pip install halmos
```

## Usage

```
$ cd /path/to/src
$ halmos
```

For more details:
```
$ halmos --help
```

## Examples

Given a contract, [Example.sol](examples/src/Example.sol):
```solidity
contract Example {
    function totalPriceBuggy(uint96 price, uint32 quantity) public pure returns (uint128) {
        unchecked {
            return uint120(price) * quantity; // buggy type casting: uint120 vs uint128
        }
    }
}
```

You write some **property tests** (in Solidity), [Example.t.sol](examples/test/Example.t.sol):
```solidity
contract ExampleTest is Example {
    function testTotalPriceBuggy(uint96 price, uint32 quantity) public pure {
        uint128 total = totalPriceBuggy(price, quantity);
        assert(quantity == 0 || total >= price);
    }
}
```

Then you can run **fuzz testing** to quickly check those properties for **some random inputs**:
```
$ forge test
[PASS] testTotalPriceBuggy(uint96,uint32) (runs: 256, Î¼: 462, ~: 466)
```

Once it passes, you can also run **symbolic testing** to check the same properties for **all possible inputs** (up to a certain bound):
```
$ halmos
[FAIL] testTotalPriceBuggy(uint96,uint32) (paths: 6, time: 0.10s, bounds: [])
Counterexample: [p_price_uint96 = 39614081294025656978550816768, p_quantity_uint32 = 1073741824]
```

_(In this particular example, Halmos found an input that violates the assertion, which was missed by the fuzzer!)_
